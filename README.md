## Core Reading: AI/CV Foundations & Geo-Grounded 3D Vision-Language Reasoning

These 20 papers form two complementary reading paths of ten papers each for **Geo-grounded 3D Vision-Language Reasoning under Incomplete and Changing Observations**. This is a function-based core, not a ranking by citations or a single leaderboard. The first path builds a shared language for visual and language foundation models. The second covers cross-view geometry, 3D representations, dynamic updates, language grounding, semantic maps, and geographic localization. Together, they frame a CV problem: how can a system construct queryable, reasoned, and actionable georegistered spatial representations from incomplete, changing, and cross-view observations?

### Purpose

The goal is not to leave GeoAI for generic computer vision detached from geographic and public problems. Instead, disaster settings serve as rigorous real-world stress tests for reliable spatial intelligence. Reading, reproducing, and combining these papers should support a doctoral signature work: a georegistered 3D spatial representation from ground, drone, and satellite observations that can update over time, answer language queries, identify evidence and uncertainty, and recommend the next observation or action.
